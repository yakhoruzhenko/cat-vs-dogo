# TO RUN CLASSIFIER PLEASE USE THIS COLAB NOTEBOOK: https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/blob/main/cat_vs_dog_0_1.ipynb

![Use case](https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/raw/main/dvc_usecase.png)

## At this moment Project has such steps:
* build dog vs cat model (https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/blob/main/cat_vs_dog_0_0_2.ipynb).
* build dog classifier (https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/blob/main/dogs_breeds_0_0_2.ipynb).
* build cat classifier (https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/blob/main/cats_breeds_0_0_2.ipynb).
* predict dog vs cat => predict dog breed or cat breed with a pretty decent accuracy (https://github.com/yarusx/cat-vs-dogo/blob/main/dog_cat_breed_0_0_2.ipynb).

## A lot things could be done less redundant, i.e. using functions/classes/imports, and definitely it will be done in the nearest future.
